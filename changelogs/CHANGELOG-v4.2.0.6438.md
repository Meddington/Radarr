# New Beta Release

Radarr v4.2.0.6438 has been released on `develop`

- **Users who do not wish to be on the alpha `nightly` testing branch should take advantage of this parity and switch to `develop`**

A reminder about the `develop` and `nightly` branches

- **develop - Current Develop/Beta - (Beta): This is the testing edge. Released after tested in nightly to ensure no immediate issues. New features and bug fixes released here first after nightly. It can be considered semi-stable, but is still beta. This version will receive updates either weekly or biweekly depending on development.**
- **nightly - Current Nightly/Unstable - (Alpha/Unstable) : This is the bleeding edge. It is released as soon as code is committed and passes all automated tests. This build may have not been used by us or other users yet. There is no guarantee that it will even run in some cases. This branch is only recommended for advanced users. Issues and self investigation are expected in this branch. Use this branch only if you know what you are doing and are willing to get your hands dirty to recover a failed update. This version is updated immediately.**
