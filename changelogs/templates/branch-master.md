- **Users who do not wish to be on the alpha `nightly` or beta `develop` testing branches should take advantage of this parity and switch to `master`

A reminder about the `develop` and `nightly` branches

- **develop - Current Develop/Beta - (Beta): This is the testing edge. Released after tested in nightly to ensure no immediate issues. New features and bug fixes released here first. This version will receive updates either weeklyish or bi-weeklyish depending on development.**
- **nightly - Current Nightly/Unstable - (Alpha/Unstable) : The bleeding edge. Released as soon as code is committed and passed all automated tests. Use this branch only if you know what you are doing and are willing to get your hands dirty to recover a failed update. This version is updated immediately.**
